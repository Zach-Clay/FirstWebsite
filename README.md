My personal website using HTML and CSS

12/14/2020:
This is my first website I have made. I haven't been taught how to use HTMl and CSS in any of my classes yet so it may not be the best but hey, I'm trying.
This will be a work in progress. I eventually want to this website to contain my resume, bio, everything so I can show my creativity when applying for jobs after college.
