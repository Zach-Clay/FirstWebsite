                <span>Hi! My name is Zach Clay. I’m 19 years old and I’m from Savannah, GA. I’m currently 
                    studying at Clemson University’s College of Engineering, Computing, and Applied 
                    Sciences. I am working towards a degree in Computer Information Systems. To tell 
                    you a little bit about myself, here are some of the things I enjoy and am passionate 
                    about: First, I love serving the Lord. I was saved by the grace of God at a young age
                    of 7 years old. Although my walk with Christ hasn’t been perfect, I strive everyday 
                    to go deeper in my relationship with the Lord and glorify Him through my actions. I 
                    love spreading the gospel to people I come in contact with and seek to disciple 
                    others into a relationship with Christ. One way that I do this is through serving 
                    on Clemson FCA’s worship team. At Clemson, we have one of the largest FCA ministries 
                    in the country. I have the amazing opportunity to serve weekly as a guitarist in 
                    order to further His kingdom. It is always the highlight of my week. I am also a 
                    brother in Clemson BYX (Brothers Under Christ), a fraternity on Clemson’s campus where I lead a small group. 
                    We meet weekly to fellowship and strengthen each other’s faith. I enjoy critical 
                    thinking and using my knowledge of coding and programming to solve problems. I 
                    constantly look forward to learning more and becoming a better computer scientist. 
                    Some of my other hobbies include hanging out with friends, spending time with family,
                    playing sports, snowboarding, and hiking.</span>
